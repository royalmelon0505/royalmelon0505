## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a 2rd-year master student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My current research interests mainly include autonomous driving scenario generation and trajectory prediction.

Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Automation(Control Science) from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/)
